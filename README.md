# NamedVillagers

A simple spigot plugin that generate names for villagers and announce when they dies. Developed to `1.19.4` and not tested in older versions.

## Why?

Well, my friend has created a SMP server for minecraft, and he gave me an idea of name every villager in our village, but the problem was nametags.
We doesn't have that much nametags to rename the whole village. The first solution was rename them all using commands, and here comes another problem
comes. Minecraft just doesn't announce when some named mob dies, it only announce when it's a pet. So the only solution is use plugins/mods, me and my
friend are developers so that's not that hard to develop some plugins to our own. There is probably already a plugin with the same purpose but it would
be cooler if I developed my own plugin. It's not that perfect but works.
